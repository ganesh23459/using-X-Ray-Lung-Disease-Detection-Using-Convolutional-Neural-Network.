# Lung X-ray Disease Detection Using CNN 🫁🔍

A deep learning-based system to detect lung diseases such as Pneumonia and Tuberculosis from chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project helps in early and accurate diagnosis with a simple web interface built using Flask.

## 🔧 Features

- Upload X-ray image and get real-time disease prediction
- Displays:
  - Disease name
  - Causes & treatments
  - Stage & future risks
  - Health and accuracy score
- Frontend with professional UI & animations
- Secure login and registration system

## 🧠 Model Details

- CNN model trained on publicly available lung X-ray datasets
- Accuracy: ~90%
- Preprocessing includes grayscale conversion, edge detection, and thresholding

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python, TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask (Backend)
- HTML/CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Bootstrap & AOS.js for animations
